This is the third faction extension mod for the 'Rimhammer - The End Times' mod series, and is intended to be used with the base Rimhammer - The End Times mod; however, that isn't required.

Required mods (all must be loaded before this mod, and in this order [although other mods can fall inbetween or after these]):
Harmony
Jec's Tools (Unofficial)
HugsLib
Doors Expanded (Dev)
Vanilla Hair Expanded
Rimhammer - The End Times [Optional]
Rimhammer - The End Times - Magic
Rimhammer - The End Times - Beastmen

The Rimhammer mods should be placed at the bottom of your mod list. Place the base Rimhammer - The End Times mod at the bottom, then the Rimhammer - Then End Times - Magic mod, then the race/faction mods under those.

This mod adds Warhammer themed The Empire into Rimworld.

The vibe for this mod that I was going for is castle building! Highly defensible with the embrasures and warmachines, fully fillable with the unique furniture and work tables, and very unique! The unique final end game quest in this mod lends itself to that defensive play style, once the Effigy of Sigmar ritual is completed, and the effigy is powering up; you must defend against the raids that will flood in until the statue is ready to smite your foes.

A detailed list of things this extension adds are as follows:
	-A unique and custom end game.
	-Armor &amp; Shields
	-Research
	-Wizards - Warhammer Magic Lores, Unique Clothing &amp; Equipment, Magic Item Crafting
	-Faith - Faith Based Pawns, Unique Powers, Custom Crafting For New Faith Powers
	-Weapons - Melee and Ranged, Swords, Pistols, Longrifles, Halberd, Spear
	-Warmachines - Hellblaster, Mortar, Great Cannon, Helstorm Rocket Battery
	-Doors and Gates
	-Castle Walls, Empire Structure walls, Embrasured Castle Walls
	-Unique Pawns - Witchhunter, Faithful of Ulric / Sigmar / Shallya, Cook, Flagellents, Soldiers, Captains, and More
	-Warhorses, Trolls (River, Stone, and Basic)
	-Apparel - A variety of unique uniforms for soliders from several different Empire States.
	-Bee Keeping &amp; Jerky Making, Cheese &amp; Bread 
	-Furniture - Beds, Double Beds, Royal Beds, Rugs, Armoire (dresser), Nightstand, Shelf, Wall Light, Ceiling Lights, Pole Light, and More
	-Unique Map Events
	-Unique Statuary
	-I'm sure there's more I've overlooked...

Current known issues:
	-If you have a shield equipped, and you try to force equip a different one, there's an error that will destroy the shield you're attempting to equip. You have to manually unequip the first shield, then you can equip the new shield. I believe this is an error with JecsTools, I have an issue open regarding it on his GitHub.

Special Thanks To:
	-Discord member @Dino's Bar and Grill for his amazing textures!
	-Discord member @Kasmex Forever for contributing the plant artwork.
	-Discord member @leugimimi for patching several popular mods to work with this mod
	-All the Discord members who helped out with testing.
	
This series will likely not be released fast. I'm one person, and the amount of work involved is significant. This mod took hundreds hours of work, no joke. It was over 11 months of work for me.

If you'd like to speed up the process of release, please consider supporting me on Patreon. The more support I get, the more motivated I will be to create more races/factions. https://www.patreon.com/SickBoyWI
