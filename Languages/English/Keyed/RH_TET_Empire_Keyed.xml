	<RH_TET_Empire_Victory>Congratulations! You've succeeded in your quest. The Effigy of Sigmar has powered completely, and released that power in a destructive blast that destroyed all enemies of Order in a very large radius. If every Empire settlement does their part, the entire world should be purged of evil, and will become a safe place to live for good folk.\n\nYour stalwart defenses have stood against everything the foul beastmen and chaos monsters could throw at them, and your victory is well deserved.\n\nThis mod was developed by Johnny Hastings (@SickBoyWI). Special thanks to @Dino's Bar and Grill for the fantastic artwork he generously donated his time and skills for that went into this mod; it made the Rimhammer - The End Times mod series that much more great.\n\nThank you for playing.\n\nYou're free to call it a win for now, or keep playing and see what else happens in the world. If that's the case, hit the escape key to return to the game.\n\nPlease look me up on Patreon, or Ko-Fi and donate what you feel this was worth! I'm one guy who spends a whole lot of time on these mods. This Empire mod took over a year to complete by itself. If you enjoyed it, then please show your love! I'll be encouraged to finish the other factions/races that much quicker if everyone contributes.</RH_TET_Empire_Victory>
